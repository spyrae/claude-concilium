# Minimal Codex config for fast, non-interactive queries.
#
# Place this at ~/.codex-minimal/config.toml
# Then symlink your auth: ln -s ~/.codex/auth.json ~/.codex-minimal/auth.json
#
# Why separate config?
# The default codex config loads ALL MCP servers on startup, which is slow.
# This minimal config has zero MCP servers, so `codex exec` starts instantly.
